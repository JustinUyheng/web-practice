					<h5>Abilities</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img src="./img/yuumi-passive.jpg">
							Passive - Bop 'n' Block
							<p>Every so often, Yuumi’s next attack against an opponent restores mana and grants her a shield. If Yuumi is Attached, the shield protects her ally. The shield protects Yuumi or her ally until it’s broken.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./img/yuumi-q.jpg">
							Q - Prowling Projectile
							<p>Yuumi fires a missile that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit. If the missile is in flight long enough, it deals bonus damage and slows enemies.<br><br>

								While Attached, Yuumi fires a missile from her ally’s position and can direct the missile’s flight path with her mouse.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./img/yuumi-w.jpg">
							W - You and Me!
							<p>Passive: While Attached, Yuumi and her ally gain a percent of each other’s AD or AP converted to Adaptive Force.
								<br><br>
								Active: Yuumi starts with a point in her W. She dashes to an ally champion and attaches to them. While Attached, she follows her partner’s movement and is untargetable by everything except tower damage. Yuumi’s abilities fire from her ally’s location, and she can’t attack enemies. There’s no cooldown to jump among her teammates. However, if Yuumi un-attaches entirely, she’ll need to wait for the cooldown to partner up, which starts as soon as she’s attached.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./img/yuumi-e.jpg">
							E - Zoomies
							<p>Yuumi heals and gains a burst of movement speed. If Attached, her ally is targeted by the spell instead. This spell has two charges.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="./img/yuumi-r.jpg">
							R - Final Chapter
							<p>Yuumi opens Book, launching waves of magic damage that root enemies after multiple hits. While using her ult, Yuumi can move, attach to ally champions, and heal.</p>
						</li>
